OpenGL Documentation
--------------------


OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a standard specification defining a
cross-language, multi-platform API for writing applications and simulating
physics, that produce 2D and 3D computer graphics. The interface consists
of over 250 different function calls which can be used to draw complex
three-dimensional scenes from simple primitives. OpenGL was developed by
Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI) in 1992 and is widely used in CAD, virtual
reality, scientific visualization, information visualization, flight
simulation, and video games. OpenGL is managed by the non-profit technology
consortium Khronos Group.
