.. rubric:: Description

..


:c:func:`glBindFragDataLocationIndexed` specifies that the varying out variable *name* in
*program* should be bound to fragment color *colorNumber* when the program is next
linked. *index* may be zero or one to specify that the color be used as either the first or second color
input to the blend equation, respectively.


The bindings specified by :c:func:`glBindFragDataLocationIndexed` have no effect until *program*
is next linked. Bindings may be specified at any time after *program* has been created. Specifically,
they may be specified before shader objects are attached to the program. Therefore, any name may be specified in *name*\ ,
including a name that is never used as a varying out variable in any fragment shader object. Names beginning with ``gl_`` are
reserved by the GL.


If *name* was bound previously, its assigned binding is replaced with *colorNumber* and
*index*\ . *name* must be a null-terminated string. *index* must be less than or equal to one,
and *colorNumber* must be less than the value of ``GL_MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS`` if *index*
is zero, and less than the value of ``GL_MAX_DUAL_SOURCE_DRAW_BUFFERS`` if index is greater than or equal to one.


In addition to the errors generated by :c:func:`glBindFragDataLocationIndexed`\ , the
program *program* will fail to link if:

         *  The number of active outputs is greater than the value ``GL_MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS``\ .
         *  More than one varying out variable is bound to the same color number.


.. note::


   Varying out varyings may have locations assigned explicitly in the shader text using a ``location``
   layout qualifier. If a shader statically assigns a location to a varying out variable in the shader text,
   that location is used and any location assigned with :c:func:`glBindFragDataLocation` is ignored.


..


.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Errors:**

* ``GL_INVALID_VALUE`` is generated if *colorNumber* is greater than or equal to ``GL_MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS``\ .
* ``GL_INVALID_VALUE`` is generated if *colorNumber* is greater than or equal to ``GL_MAX_DUAL_SOURCE_DRAW_BUFERS`` and *index* is greater than or equal to one.
* ``GL_INVALID_VALUE`` is generated if *index* is greater than one.
* ``GL_INVALID_OPERATION`` is generated if *name* starts with the reserved ``gl_`` prefix.
* ``GL_INVALID_OPERATION`` is generated if :c:func:`program` is not the name of a program object.


.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Associated Gets:**

* :c:func:`glGetFragDataLocation` with a valid program object and the the name of a user-defined varying out variable
* :c:func:`glGetFragDataIndex` with a valid program object and the the name of a user-defined varying out variable
