.. rubric:: Description

..


:c:func:`glGetActiveUniformBlockName` retrieves the name of the active uniform block at *uniformBlockIndex*
within *program*\ .


*program* must be the name of a program object for which the command
:c:func:`glLinkProgram` must have been called in the past, although it is not required that
:c:func:`glLinkProgram` must have succeeded. The link could have failed because the number
of active uniforms exceeded the limit.


*uniformBlockIndex* is an active uniform block index of *program*\ , and must be less than the value
of ``GL_ACTIVE_UNIFORM_BLOCKS``\ .


Upon success, the name of the uniform block identified by *unifomBlockIndex* is returned into
*uniformBlockName*\ . The name is nul-terminated. The actual number of characters written into *uniformBlockName*\ ,
excluding the nul terminator, is returned in *length*\ . If *length* is ``NULL``\ , no length is returned.


*bufSize* contains the maximum number of characters (including the nul terminator) that will be written into
*uniformBlockName*\ .


If an error occurs, nothing will be written to *uniformBlockName* or *length*\ .


.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Errors:**

* ``GL_INVALID_OPERATION`` is generated if *program* is not the name of a program object for which :c:func:`glLinkProgram` has been called in the past.
* ``GL_INVALID_VALUE`` is generated if *uniformBlockIndex* is greater than or equal to the value of ``GL_ACTIVE_UNIFORM_BLOCKS`` or is not the index of an active uniform block in *program*\ .


.. note::


   :c:func:`glGetActiveUniformBlockName` is available only if the GL version is 3.1 or greater.
