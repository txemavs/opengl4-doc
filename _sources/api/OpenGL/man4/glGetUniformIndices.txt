Retrieve the index of a named uniform block

.. c:function:: glGetUniformIndices


         :param program:

                  Specifies the name of a program containing uniforms whose indices to query.

         :param uniformCount:

                  Specifies the number of uniforms whose indices to query.

         :param uniformNames:

                  Specifies the address of an array of pointers to buffers containing the names of the queried uniforms.

         :param uniformIndices:

                  Specifies the address of an array that will receive the indices of the uniforms.

.. rubric:: Description

..


:c:func:`glGetUniformIndices` retrieves the indices of a number of uniforms within *program*\ .


*program* must be the name of a program object for which the command
:c:func:`glLinkProgram` must have been called in the past, although it is not required that
:c:func:`glLinkProgram` must have succeeded. The link could have failed because the number
of active uniforms exceeded the limit.


*uniformCount* indicates both the number of elements in the array of names *uniformNames* and the
number of indices that may be written to *uniformIndices*\ .


*uniformNames* contains a list of *uniformCount* name strings identifying the uniform names to be
queried for indices. For each name string in *uniformNames*\ , the index assigned to the active uniform of that name will
be written to the corresponding element of *uniformIndices*\ . If a string in *uniformNames* is not
the name of an active uniform, the special value ``GL_INVALID_INDEX`` will be written to the corresponding element of
*uniformIndices*\ .


If an error occurs, nothing is written to *uniformIndices*\ .


.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Errors:**

* ``GL_INVALID_OPERATION`` is generated if *program* is not the name of a program object for which :c:func:`glLinkProgram` has been called in the past.


.. note::


   :c:func:`glGetUniformIndices` is available only if the GL version is 3.1 or greater.
