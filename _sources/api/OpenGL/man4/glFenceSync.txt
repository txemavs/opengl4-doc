Create a new sync object and insert it into the GL command stream

         :param condition:

                  Specifies the condition that must be met to set the sync object's state to signaled. *condition*

                  Specifies a bitwise combination of flags controlling the behavior of the sync object. No flags are presently defined
                  for this operation and *flags* must be zero. [1]_

.. rubric:: Description

..


:c:func:`glFenceSync` creates a new fence sync object, inserts a fence command into the GL command stream and
associates it with that sync object, and returns a non-zero name corresponding to the sync object.


When the specified *condition* of the sync object is satisfied by the fence command, the sync object
is signaled by the GL, causing any :c:func:`glWaitSync`\ ,
:c:func:`glClientWaitSync` commands blocking in *sync*
to :strong:`unblock`\ . No other state is affected by :c:func:`glFenceSync` or by the execution
of the associated fence command.


*condition* must be ``GL_SYNC_GPU_COMMANDS_COMPLETE``\ . This condition is satisfied by
completion of the fence command corresponding to the sync object and all preceding commands in the same command stream.
The sync object will not be signaled until all effects from these commands on GL client and server state and the
framebuffer are fully realized. Note that completion of the fence command occurs once the state of the corresponding sync
object has been changed, but commands waiting on that sync object may not be unblocked until after the fence command completes.


.. note::

   :c:func:`glFenceSync` is only supported if the GL version is 3.2 or greater, or if
   the ``ARB_sync`` extension is supported.

..


.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Errors:**

* ``GL_INVALID_ENUM`` is generated if *condition* is not ``GL_SYNC_GPU_COMMANDS_COMPLETE``\ .
* ``GL_INVALID_VALUE`` is generated if *flags* is not zero.
* Additionally, if :c:func:`glFenceSync` fails, it will return zero.
