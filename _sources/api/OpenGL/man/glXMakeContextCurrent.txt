.. rubric:: Description

..


:c:func:`glXMakeContextCurrent` binds *ctx* to the current rendering thread and to the *draw*
and *read* GLX drawables. *draw* and *read* may be the same.


*draw* is used for all OpenGL operations except:


Any pixel data that are read based on the value of ``GLX_READ_BUFFER``\ .
Note that accumulation operations use the value of ``GLX_READ_BUFFER``\ ,
but are not allowed unless *draw* is identical to *read*\ .


Any depth values that are retrieved by :c:func:`glReadPixels` or :c:func:`glCopyPixels`\ .


Any stencil values that are retrieved by :c:func:`glReadPixels` or
:c:func:`glCopyPixels`\ .


Frame buffer values are taken from *draw*\ .


If the current rendering thread has a current rendering context, that
context is flushed and replaced by *ctx*\ .


The first time that *ctx* is made current, the viewport and scissor
dimensions are set to the size of the *draw* drawable.  The viewport
and scissor are not modified when *ctx* is subsequently made current.


To release the current context without assigning a new one,
call :c:func:`glXMakeContextCurrent` with *draw* and *read* set to ``None`` and *ctx*
set to ``NULL``\ .


:c:func:`glXMakeContextCurrent` returns ``True`` if it is successful,
``False`` otherwise.
If ``False`` is returned, the previously current rendering context
and drawable (if any) remain unchanged.


.. note::


   :c:func:`glXMakeContextCurrent` is available only if the GLX version is 1.3 or greater.


   If the GLX version is 1.1 or 1.0, the GL version must be 1.0.
   If the GLX version is 1.2, then the GL version must be 1.1.
   If the GLX version is 1.3, then the GL version must be 1.2.

**Errors:**

* ``BadMatch`` is generated if *draw* and *read* are not compatible.
* ``BadAccess`` is generated if *ctx* is current to some other thread.
* ``GLXContextState`` is generated if there is a current rendering context and its render mode is either ``GLX_FEEDBACK`` or ``GLX_SELECT``\ .
* ``GLXBadContext`` is generated if *ctx* is not a valid GLX rendering context.
* ``GLXBadDrawable`` is generated if *draw* or *read* is not a valid GLX drawable.
* ``GLXBadWindow`` is generated if the underlying X window for either *draw* or *read* is no longer valid.
* ``GLXBadCurrentDrawable`` is generated if the previous context of the calling thread has unflushed commands and the previous drawable is no longer valid.
* ``BadAlloc`` is generated if the X server does not have enough resources to allocate the buffers.
* ``BadMatch`` is generated if:
* *draw* and *read* cannot fit into frame buffer memory simultaneously.
* *draw* or *read* is a GLXPixmap and *ctx* is a direct-rendering context.
* *draw* or *read* is a GLXPixmap and *ctx* was previously bound to a GLXWindow or GLXPbuffer.
* *draw* or *read* is a GLXWindow or GLXPbuffer and *ctx* was previously bound to a GLXPixmap.
