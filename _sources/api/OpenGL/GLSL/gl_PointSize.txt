.. rubric:: Description


In the vertex, tessellation evaluation and geoemtry languages, a single global instance of the :c:func:`gl_PerVertex` named block is available and its :c:func:`gl_PointSize` member is an output that receives the intended size of the point to be rasterized, in pixels. It may be written at any time during shader execution. If ``GL_PROGRAM_POINT_SIZE`` is enabled, :c:func:`gl_PointSize` is used to determine the size of rasterized points, otherwise it is ignored by the rasterization stage.

In the tessellation control language, the :c:func:`gl_PerVertex` named block is used to construct an array, :c:func:`gl_out[]`, whose members become available as inputs to the subsequent tessellation evaluation shader.

The value of :c:func:`gl_PointSize` (or the :c:func:`gl_PointSize` member of the :c:func:`gl_out[]` array, in the case of the tessellation control shader) is undefined after the vertex, tessellation control, and tessellation evaluation shading stages if the corresponding shader executable does not write to gl_PointSize. It is also undefined after the geometry processing stage if the geometry shader executable calls :c:func:`EmitVertex` without having written :c:func:`gl_PointSize` since the last call to :c:func:`EmitVertex` (or hasn't written it at all).

In the tessellation control, tessellation evaluation and geoemetry languages, the :c:func:`gl_PerVertex` named block is used to construct an array, :c:func:`gl_in[]` of per-vertex or per-control point inputs whose content represents the corresponding outputs written by the previous stage.
