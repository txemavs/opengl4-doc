Define a picking region

.. c:function:: gluPickMatrix
.. c:function:: void gluPickMatrix(GLdouble  x, GLdouble  y, GLdouble  delX, GLdouble  delY, GLint *  viewport)
   :noindex: 


   
   :param x:
      Specify the center of a picking region in window coordinates.
   
   :param delX:
      Specify the width and height, respectively, of the picking region in window coordinates.
   
   :param viewport:
      Specifies the current viewport (as from a :c:func:`glGetIntegerv` call).

.. rubric:: Description


:c:func:`gluPickMatrix` creates a projection matrix that can be used to restrict drawing to a small region of the viewport. This is typically useful to determine what objects are being drawn near the cursor. Use :c:func:`gluPickMatrix` to restrict drawing to a small region around the cursor. Then, enter selection mode (with :c:func:`glRenderMode`) and rerender the scene. All primitives that would have been drawn near the cursor are identified and stored in the selection buffer.

The matrix created by :c:func:`gluPickMatrix` is multiplied by the current matrix just as if :c:func:`glMultMatrix` is called with the generated matrix. To effectively use the generated pick matrix for picking, first call :c:func:`glLoadIdentity` to load an identity matrix onto the perspective matrix stack. Then call :c:func:`gluPickMatrix`, and, finally, call a command (such as :c:func:`gluPerspective`) to multiply the perspective matrix by the pick matrix.

When using :c:func:`gluPickMatrix` to pick NURBS, be careful to turn off the NURBS property ``GLU_AUTO_LOAD_MATRIX``. If ``GLU_AUTO_LOAD_MATRIX`` is not turned off, then any NURBS surface rendered is subdivided differently with the pick matrix than the way it was subdivided without the pick matrix.
