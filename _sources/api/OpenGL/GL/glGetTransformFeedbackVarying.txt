   :noindex: 


   
   :param program:
      The name of the target program object.
   
   :param index:
      The index of the varying variable whose information to retrieve.
   
   :param bufSize:
      The maximum number of characters, including the null terminator, that may be written into *name* .
   
   :param length:
      The address of a variable which will receive the number of characters written into *name* , excluding the null-terminator. If *length* is ``NULL`` no length is returned.
   
   :param size:
      The address of a variable that will receive the size of the varying.
   
   :param type:
      The address of a variable that will recieve the type of the varying.
   
   :param name:
      The address of a buffer into which will be written the name of the varying.

.. rubric:: Description


Information about the set of varying variables in a linked program that will be captured during transform feedback may be retrieved by calling :c:func:`glGetTransformFeedbackVarying`. :c:func:`glGetTransformFeedbackVarying` provides information about the varying variable selected by *index* . An *index* of 0 selects the first varying variable specified in the *varyings* array passed to :c:func:`glTransformFeedbackVaryings`, and an *index* of ``GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_VARYINGS-1`` selects the last such variable.

The name of the selected varying is returned as a null-terminated string in *name* . The actual number of characters written into *name* , excluding the null terminator, is returned in *length* . If *length* is NULL, no length is returned. The maximum number of characters that may be written into *name* , including the null terminator, is specified by *bufSize* .

The length of the longest varying name in program is given by ``GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_VARYING_MAX_LENGTH``, which can be queried with :c:func:`glGetProgram`.

For the selected varying variable, its type is returned into *type* . The size of the varying is returned into *size* . The value in *size* is in units of the type returned in *type* . The type returned can be any of the scalar, vector, or matrix attribute types returned by :c:func:`glGetActiveAttrib`. If an error occurred, the return parameters *length* , *size* , *type* and *name* will be unmodified. This command will return as much information about the varying variables as possible. If no information is available, *length* will be set to zero and *name* will be an empty string. This situation could arise if :c:func:`glGetTransformFeedbackVarying` is called after a failed link.


**Associated gets:**


   * :c:func:`glGetProgram` with argument ``GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_VARYING_MAX_LENGTH``.

**Errors:**

   * ``GL_INVALID_VALUE`` is generated if *program* is not the name of a program object.
   * ``GL_INVALID_VALUE`` is generated if *index* is greater or equal to the value of ``GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_VARYINGS``.
   * ``GL_INVALID_OPERATION`` is generated *program* has not been linked.
