   :param program:
      Specifies the name of the program containing the subroutine.
   
   :param shadertype:
      Specifies the shader stage from which to query for the subroutine parameter. *shadertype* must be one of ``GL_VERTEX_SHADER``, ``GL_TESS_CONTROL_SHADER``, ``GL_TESS_EVALUATION_SHADER``, ``GL_GEOMETRY_SHADER`` or ``GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER``.
   
   :param index:
      Specifies the index of the shader subroutine uniform.
   
   :param bufsize:
      Specifies the size of the buffer whose address is given in *name* .
   
   :param length:
      Specifies the address of a variable into which is written the number of characters copied into *name* .
   
   :param name:
      Specifies the address of a buffer that will receive the name of the specified shader subroutine uniform.

.. rubric:: Description


:c:func:`glGetActiveSubroutineUniformName` retrieves the name of an active shader subroutine uniform. *program* contains the name of the program containing the uniform. *shadertype* specifies the stage for which which the uniform location, given by *index* , is valid. *index* must be between zero and the value of ``GL_ACTIVE_SUBROUTINE_UNIFORMS`` minus one for the shader stage.

The uniform name is returned as a null-terminated string in *name* . The actual number of characters written into *name* , excluding the null terminator is returned in *length* . If *length* is ``NULL``, no length is returned. The maximum number of characters that may be written into *name* , including the null terminator, is specified by *bufsize* . The length of the longest subroutine uniform name in *program* and *shadertype* is given by the value of ``GL_ACTIVE_SUBROUTINE_UNIFORM_MAX_LENGTH``, which can be queried with :c:func:`glGetProgramStage`.


**Associated gets:**


   * :c:func:`glGetProgramStage` with argument ``GL_ACTIVE_SUBROUTINE_UNIFORMS``

**Errors:**

   * ``GL_INVALID_ENUM`` is generated if *shadertype* or *pname* is not one of the accepted values.
   * ``GL_INVALID_VALUE`` is generated if *index* is greater than or equal to the value of ``GL_ACTIVE_SUBROUTINES``.
   * ``GL_INVALID_VALUE`` is generated if *program* is not the name of an existing program object.
