.. rubric:: Description


:c:func:`glDeleteSamplers` deletes *n* sampler objects named by the elements of the array *ids* . After a sampler object is deleted, its name is again unused. If a sampler object that is currently bound to a sampler unit is deleted, it is as though :c:func:`glBindSampler` is called with unit set to the unit the sampler is bound to and sampler zero. Unused names in samplers are silently ignored, as is the reserved name zero.


**Associated gets:**


   * :c:func:`glIsSampler`

**Errors:**

   * ``GL_INVALID_VALUE`` is generated if *n* is negative.



.. note::

   * :c:func:`glDeleteSamplers` is available only if the GL version is 3.3 or higher.
