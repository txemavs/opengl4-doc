.. currentmodule:: OpenGL.GL

Generate sampler object names

.. c:function:: glGenSamplers
.. c:function:: void glGenSamplers(GLsizei  n, GLuint * samplers)
   :noindex: 


   
   :param n:
      Specifies the number of sampler object names to generate.
   
   :param samplers:
      Specifies an array in which the generated sampler object names are stored.

.. rubric:: Description


:c:func:`glGenSamplers` returns *n* sampler object names in *samplers* . There is no guarantee that the names form a contiguous set of integers; however, it is guaranteed that none of the returned names was in use immediately before the call to :c:func:`glGenSamplers`.

Sampler object names returned by a call to :c:func:`glGenSamplers` are not returned by subsequent calls, unless they are first deleted with :c:func:`glDeleteSamplers`.

The names returned in *samplers* are marked as used, for the purposes of :c:func:`glGenSamplers` only, but they acquire state and type only when they are first bound.


**Errors:**

   * ``GL_INVALID_VALUE`` is generated if *n* is negative.



.. note::

   * :c:func:`glGenSamplers` is available only if the GL version is 3.3 or higher.
