Assign a binding point to an active uniform block

.. c:function:: glUniformBlockBinding
.. c:function:: void glUniformBlockBinding(GLuint  program, GLuint  uniformBlockIndex, GLuint  uniformBlockBinding)
   :noindex: 


   
   :param program:
      The name of a program object containing the active uniform block whose binding to assign.
   
   :param uniformBlockIndex:
      The index of the active uniform block within *program* whose binding to assign.
   
   :param uniformBlockBinding:
      Specifies the binding point to which to bind the uniform block with index *uniformBlockIndex* within *program* .

.. rubric:: Description


Binding points for active uniform blocks are assigned using :c:func:`glUniformBlockBinding`. Each of a program's active uniform blocks has a corresponding uniform buffer binding point. *program* is the name of a program object for which the command :c:func:`glLinkProgram` has been issued in the past.

If successful, :c:func:`glUniformBlockBinding` specifies that *program* will use the data store of the buffer object bound to the binding point *uniformBlockBinding* to extract the values of the uniforms in the uniform block identified by *uniformBlockIndex* .

When a program object is linked or re-linked, the uniform buffer object binding point assigned to each of its active uniform blocks is reset to zero.


**Associated gets:**


   * :c:func:`glGetActiveUniformBlock` with argument ``GL_UNIFORM_BLOCK_BINDING``

**Errors:**

   * ``GL_INVALID_VALUE`` is generated if *uniformBlockIndex* is not an active uniform block index of *program* .
   * ``GL_INVALID_VALUE`` is generated if *uniformBlockBinding* is greater than or equal to the value of ``GL_MAX_UNIFORM_BUFFER_BINDINGS``.
   * ``GL_INVALID_VALUE`` is generated *program* is not the name of a program object generated by the GL.



.. note::

   * :c:func:`glUniformBlockBinding` is available only if the GL version is 3.1 or greater.
