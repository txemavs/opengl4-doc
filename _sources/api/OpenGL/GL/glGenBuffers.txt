Generate buffer object names

.. c:function:: glGenBuffers
.. c:function:: void glGenBuffers(GLsizei  n, GLuint *  buffers)
   :noindex: 


   
   :param n:
      Specifies the number of buffer object names to be generated.
   
   :param buffers:
      Specifies an array in which the generated buffer object names are stored.

.. rubric:: Description


:c:func:`glGenBuffers` returns *n* buffer object names in *buffers* . There is no guarantee that the names form a contiguous set of integers; however, it is guaranteed that none of the returned names was in use immediately before the call to :c:func:`glGenBuffers`.

Buffer object names returned by a call to :c:func:`glGenBuffers` are not returned by subsequent calls, unless they are first deleted with :c:func:`glDeleteBuffers`.

No buffer objects are associated with the returned buffer object names until they are first bound by calling :c:func:`glBindBuffer`.


**Associated gets:**


   * :c:func:`glIsBuffer`

**Errors:**

   * ``GL_INVALID_VALUE`` is generated if *n* is negative.
