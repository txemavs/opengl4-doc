Select a polygon rasterization mode

.. c:function:: glPolygonMode
.. c:function:: void glPolygonMode(GLenum  face, GLenum  mode)
   :noindex: 


   
   :param face:
      Specifies the polygons that *mode* applies to. Must be ``GL_FRONT_AND_BACK`` for front- and back-facing polygons.
   
   :param mode:
      Specifies how polygons will be rasterized. Accepted values are ``GL_POINT``, ``GL_LINE``, and ``GL_FILL``. The initial value is ``GL_FILL`` for both front- and back-facing polygons.

.. rubric:: Description


:c:func:`glPolygonMode` controls the interpretation of polygons for rasterization. *face* describes which polygons *mode* applies to: both front and back-facing polygons (``GL_FRONT_AND_BACK``). The polygon mode affects only the final rasterization of polygons. In particular, a polygon's vertices are lit and the polygon is clipped and possibly culled before these modes are applied.

Three modes are defined and can be specified in *mode* :


   
   ``GL_POINT``
      Polygon vertices that are marked as the start of a boundary edge are drawn as points. Point attributes such as ``GL_POINT_SIZE`` and ``GL_POINT_SMOOTH`` control the rasterization of the points. Polygon rasterization attributes other than ``GL_POLYGON_MODE`` have no effect.
   
   ``GL_LINE``
      Boundary edges of the polygon are drawn as line segments. Line attributes such as ``GL_LINE_WIDTH`` and ``GL_LINE_SMOOTH`` control the rasterization of the lines. Polygon rasterization attributes other than ``GL_POLYGON_MODE`` have no effect.
   
   ``GL_FILL``
      The interior of the polygon is filled. Polygon attributes such as ``GL_POLYGON_SMOOTH`` control the rasterization of the polygon.
   

**Associated gets:**


   * :c:func:`glGet` with argument ``GL_POLYGON_MODE``

**Errors:**

   * ``GL_INVALID_ENUM`` is generated if either *face* or *mode* is not an accepted value.



.. note::

   * Vertices are marked as boundary or nonboundary with an edge flag. Edge flags are generated internally by the GL when it decomposes triangle stips and fans.
