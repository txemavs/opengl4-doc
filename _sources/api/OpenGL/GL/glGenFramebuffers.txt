.. currentmodule:: OpenGL.GL

Generate framebuffer object names

.. c:function:: glGenFramebuffers
.. c:function:: void glGenFramebuffers(GLsizei  n, GLuint * ids)
   :noindex: 


   
   :param n:
      Specifies the number of framebuffer object names to generate.
   
   :param ids:
      Specifies an array in which the generated framebuffer object names are stored.

.. rubric:: Description


:c:func:`glGenFramebuffers` returns *n* framebuffer object names in *ids* . There is no guarantee that the names form a contiguous set of integers; however, it is guaranteed that none of the returned names was in use immediately before the call to :c:func:`glGenFramebuffers`.

Framebuffer object names returned by a call to :c:func:`glGenFramebuffers` are not returned by subsequent calls, unless they are first deleted with :c:func:`glDeleteFramebuffers`.

The names returned in *ids* are marked as used, for the purposes of :c:func:`glGenFramebuffers` only, but they acquire state and type only when they are first bound.


**Errors:**

   * ``GL_INVALID_VALUE`` is generated if *n* is negative.
