   :param program:
      Specifies the name of a program containing uniforms whose indices to query.
   
   :param uniformCount:
      Specifies the number of uniforms whose indices to query.
   
   :param uniformNames:
      Specifies the address of an array of pointers to buffers containing the names of the queried uniforms.
   
   :param uniformIndices:
      Specifies the address of an array that will receive the indices of the uniforms.

.. rubric:: Description


:c:func:`glGetUniformIndices` retrieves the indices of a number of uniforms within *program* .

*program* must be the name of a program object for which the command :c:func:`glLinkProgram` must have been called in the past, although it is not required that :c:func:`glLinkProgram` must have succeeded. The link could have failed because the number of active uniforms exceeded the limit.

*uniformCount* indicates both the number of elements in the array of names *uniformNames* and the number of indices that may be written to *uniformIndices* .

*uniformNames* contains a list of *uniformCount* name strings identifying the uniform names to be queried for indices. For each name string in *uniformNames* , the index assigned to the active uniform of that name will be written to the corresponding element of *uniformIndices* . If a string in *uniformNames* is not the name of an active uniform, the special value ``GL_INVALID_INDEX`` will be written to the corresponding element of *uniformIndices* .

If an error occurs, nothing is written to *uniformIndices* .


**Errors:**

   * ``GL_INVALID_OPERATION`` is generated if *program* is not the name of a program object for which :c:func:`glLinkProgram` has been called in the past.



.. note::

   * :c:func:`glGetUniformIndices` is available only if the GL version is 3.1 or greater.
