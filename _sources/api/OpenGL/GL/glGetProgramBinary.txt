.. rubric:: Description


:c:func:`glGetProgramBinary` returns a binary representation of the compiled and linked executable for *program* into the array of bytes whose address is specified in *binary* . The maximum number of bytes that may be written into *binary* is specified by *bufSize* . If the program binary is greater in size than *bufSize* bytes, then an error is generated, otherwise the actual number of bytes written into *binary* is returned in the variable whose address is given by *length* . If *length* is ``NULL``, then no length is returned.

The format of the program binary written into *binary* is returned in the variable whose address is given by *binaryFormat* , and may be implementation dependent. The binary produced by the GL may subsequently be returned to the GL by calling :c:func:`glProgramBinary`, with *binaryFormat* and *length* set to the values returned by :c:func:`glGetProgramBinary`, and passing the returned binary data in the *binary* parameter.


**Associated gets:**


   * :c:func:`glGetProgram` with argument ``GL_PROGRAM_BINARY_LENGTH``

**Errors:**

   * ``GL_INVALID_OPERATION`` is generated if *bufSize* is less than the size of ``GL_PROGRAM_BINARY_LENGTH`` for *program* .
   * ``GL_INVALID_OPERATION`` is generated if ``GL_LINK_STATUS`` for the program object is false.
