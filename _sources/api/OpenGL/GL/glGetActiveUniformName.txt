.. currentmodule:: OpenGL.GL

Query the name of an active uniform

.. c:function:: glGetActiveUniformName
.. c:function:: void glGetActiveUniformName(GLuint  program, GLuint  uniformIndex, GLsizei  bufSize, GLsizei * length, GLchar * uniformName)
   :noindex: 


   
   :param program:
      Specifies the program containing the active uniform index *uniformIndex* .
   
   :param uniformIndex:
      Specifies the index of the active uniform whose name to query.
   
   :param bufSize:
      Specifies the size of the buffer, in units of ``GLchar``, of the buffer whose address is specified in *uniformName* .
   
   :param length:
      Specifies the address of a variable that will receive the number of characters that were or would have been written to the buffer addressed by *uniformName* .
   
   :param uniformName:
      Specifies the address of a buffer into which the GL will place the name of the active uniform at *uniformIndex* within *program* .

.. rubric:: Description


:c:func:`glGetActiveUniformName` returns the name of the active uniform at *uniformIndex* within *program* . If *uniformName* is not ``NULL``, up to *bufSize* characters (including a nul-terminator) will be written into the array whose address is specified by *uniformName* . If *length* is not ``NULL``, the number of characters that were (or would have been) written into *uniformName* (not including the nul-terminator) will be placed in the variable whose address is specified in *length* . If *length* is ``NULL``, no length is returned. The length of the longest uniform name in *program* is given by the value of ``GL_ACTIVE_UNIFORM_MAX_LENGTH``, which can be queried with :c:func:`glGetProgram`.

If :c:func:`glGetActiveUniformName` is not successful, nothing is written to *length* or *uniformName* .

*program* must be the name of a program for which the command :c:func:`glLinkProgram` has been issued in the past. It is not necessary for *program* to have been linked successfully. The link could have failed because the number of active uniforms exceeded the limit.

*uniformIndex* must be an active uniform index of the program *program* , in the range zero to ``GL_ACTIVE_UNIFORMS`` - 1. The value of ``GL_ACTIVE_UNIFORMS`` can be queried with :c:func:`glGetProgram`.


**Errors:**

   * ``GL_INVALID_VALUE`` is generated if *uniformIndex* is greater than or equal to the value of ``GL_ACTIVE_UNIFORMS``.
   * ``GL_INVALID_VALUE`` is generated if *bufSize* is negative.
   * ``GL_INVALID_VALUE`` is generated if *program* is not the name of a program object for which :c:func:`glLinkProgram` has been issued.
