Bind a user-defined varying out variable to a fragment shader color number

.. c:function:: glBindFragDataLocation
.. c:function:: void glBindFragDataLocation(GLuint  program, GLuint  colorNumber, const char *  name)
   :noindex: 


   
   :param program:
      The name of the program containing varying out variable whose binding to modify
   
   :param colorNumber:
      The color number to bind the user-defined varying out variable to
   
   :param name:
      The name of the user-defined varying out variable whose binding to modify

.. rubric:: Description


:c:func:`glBindFragDataLocation` explicitly specifies the binding of the user-defined varying out variable *name* to fragment shader color number *colorNumber* for program *program* . If *name* was bound previously, its assigned binding is replaced with *colorNumber* . *name* must be a null-terminated string. *colorNumber* must be less than ``GL_MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS``.

The bindings specified by :c:func:`glBindFragDataLocation` have no effect until *program* is next linked. Bindings may be specified at any time after *program* has been created. Specifically, they may be specified before shader objects are attached to the program. Therefore, any name may be specified in *name* , including a name that is never used as a varying out variable in any fragment shader object. Names beginning with ``gl_`` are reserved by the GL.

In addition to the errors generated by :c:func:`glBindFragDataLocation`, the program *program* will fail to link if: 
 
   - The number of active outputs is greater than the value ``GL_MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS``. 
   - More than one varying out variable is bound to the same color number. 


**Associated gets:**


   * :c:func:`glGetFragDataLocation` with a valid program object and the the name of a user-defined varying out variable

**Errors:**

   * ``GL_INVALID_VALUE`` is generated if *colorNumber* is greater than or equal to ``GL_MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS``.
   * ``GL_INVALID_OPERATION`` is generated if *name* starts with the reserved ``gl_`` prefix.
   * ``GL_INVALID_OPERATION`` is generated if :c:func:`program` is not the name of a program object.



.. note::

   * Varying out varyings may have indexed locations assigned explicitly in the shader text using a ``location`` layout qualifier. If a shader statically assigns a location to a varying out variable in the shader text, that location is used and any location assigned with :c:func:`glBindFragDataLocation` is ignored.
