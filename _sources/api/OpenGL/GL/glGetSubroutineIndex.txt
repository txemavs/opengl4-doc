Retrieve the index of a subroutine uniform of a given shader stage within a program

.. c:function:: glGetSubroutineIndex
.. c:function:: GLuint glGetSubroutineIndex(GLuint  program, GLenum  shadertype, const GLchar * name)
   :noindex: 


   
   :param program:
      Specifies the name of the program containing shader stage.
   
   :param shadertype:
      Specifies the shader stage from which to query for subroutine uniform index. *shadertype* must be one of ``GL_VERTEX_SHADER``, ``GL_TESS_CONTROL_SHADER``, ``GL_TESS_EVALUATION_SHADER``, ``GL_GEOMETRY_SHADER`` or ``GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER``.
   
   :param name:
      Specifies the name of the subroutine uniform whose index to query.

.. rubric:: Description


:c:func:`glGetSubroutineIndex` returns the index of a subroutine uniform within a shader stage attached to a program object. *program* contains the name of the program to which the shader is attached. *shadertype* specifies the stage from which to query shader subroutine index. *name* contains the null-terminated name of the subroutine uniform whose name to query.

If *name* is not the name of a subroutine uniform in the shader stage, ``GL_INVALID_INDEX`` is returned, but no error is generated. If *name* is the name of a subroutine uniform in the shader stage, a value between zero and the value of ``GL_ACTIVE_SUBROUTINES`` minus one will be returned. Subroutine indices are assigned using consecutive integers in the range from zero to the value of ``GL_ACTIVE_SUBROUTINES`` minus one for the shader stage.


**Errors:**

   * ``GL_INVALID_ENUM`` is generated if *shadertype* or *pname* is not one of the accepted values.
   * ``GL_INVALID_VALUE`` is generated if *program* is not the name of an existing program object.
